# TDLib usage and build examples

This directory contains basic examples of TDLib usage from different programming languages and examples of library building for different platforms.
If you are looking for documentation of all available TDLib methods, see the [td_api.tl](https://github.com/tdlib/td/blob/master/td/generate/scheme/td_api.tl) scheme or the
automatically generated [HTML documentation](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/docs/td__api_8h.html) for a list of all available TDLib
[methods](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/docs/classtd_1_1td__api_1_1_function.html) and [classes](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/docs/classtd_1_1td__api_1_1_object.html).
Also, take a look at our [Getting Started](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib/getting-started) tutorial for a description of basic TDLib concepts.

TDLib can be easily used from almost any programming language on any platform. See a [TDLib build instructions generator](https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html) for detailed instructions on how to build TDLib.

## Using TDLib in Python projects

TDLib can be used from Python through the [JSON](https://github.com/tdlib/td#using-json) interface.

Convenient Python wrappers already exist for our JSON interface.

If you use Python >= 3.6, take a look at [python-telegram](https://github.com/alexander-akhmetov/python-telegram).
The wrapper uses the full power of asyncio, has a good documentation and has several examples. It can be installed through pip or used in a Docker container.
You can also try a fork [python-telegram](https://github.com/iTeam-co/pytglib) of this library.

If you want to use TDLib with asyncio and Python >= 3.9, take a look at [aiotdlib](https://github.com/pylakey/aiotdlib) or [Pytdbot](https://github.com/pytdbot/client).

For older Python versions you can use [pytdlib](https://github.com/pytdlib/pytdlib).
This wrapper contains generator for TDLib API classes and basic interface for interaction with TDLib.

You can also check out [example/python/tdjson_example.py](https://github.com/tdlib/td/blob/master/example/python/tdjson_example.py),
[tdlib-python](https://github.com/JunaidBabu/tdlib-python), or [Python Wrapper TDLib](https://github.com/alvhix/pywtdlib) for some basic examples of TDLib JSON interface integration with Python.
